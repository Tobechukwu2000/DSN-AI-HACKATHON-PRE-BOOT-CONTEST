Sapa.com is one of the leading eCommerce platforms in Nigeria with millions of daily complete transactions. The goods and services on sapa.com cater for both the elite and the masses which makes it the first choice for almost everybody in Nigeria. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that struck the entire world in all areas of living, the companies' daily complete transactions have dropped drastically to thousands.
